- 👋 Hi, I’m @grandonia, physics professor of a State University here in Brazil (www.fatecpompeia.edu.br)
- 👀 I’m interested in spectroscopy (from infrared to x-rays) and many other sensors that can measure pests and diseases in agriculture
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to identify and monitor this pests and diseases in crops
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on people that are also pursuing the goal to localize pests and diseases in large crop fields in order to avoid spraying pesticides everywhere and apply biopesticides only where needed.
